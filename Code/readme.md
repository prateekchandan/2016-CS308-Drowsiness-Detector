##Project Description 

 
Sleep deprivation affects driving as much as (and sometimes more than) alcohol. It has been estimated that approximately 20% of vehicle accidents have sleep deprivation as a cause.According to the National Sleep Foundation’s 2005 Sleep in America poll, 60% of adult drivers – about 168 million people – say they have driven a vehicle while feeling drowsy in the past year, and more than one-third, (37% of 103 million people), have actually fallen asleep at the wheel! In fact, of those who have nodded off, 13% say they have done so at least once a month. Four percent – approximately eleven million drivers – admit they have had an accident or near accident because they dozed off or were too tired to drive.

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration conservatively estimates that 100,000 police-reported crashes are the direct result of driver fatigue each year. This results in an estimated 1,550 deaths, 71,000 injuries, and $12.5 billion in monetary losses. These figures may be the tip of the iceberg, since currently it is difficult to attribute crashes to sleepiness.

Noticing the trend and studying the factors of the person sleeping few common things could be noticed like the pulse rate of the person drops , the person starts blinking eye quickly and with longer durations , there could be difference in the driving way etc. We have exploited the first two important factor. We have used sensors to determine the heart rate and eye blink duration. Using those readings we will determine if the person is sleeping or not and based upon that we will raise an alarm

This project , “drowsiness detection system” will detect that and can be installed in the cars to prevent drowsiness based accidents
